PHP Knowledge Evaluation for Candidate
Welcome to the PHP Knowledge Evaluation repository! Here, we invite you to showcase your skills by implementing a solution that passes the provided unit tests.

To get started, navigate to the tests folder to familiarize yourself with the expected outcomes from your implementation. Your task is to write the necessary classes in a reliable and efficient manner.

Here are the expectations we have for your submission:

Readable Implementation: It is essential to have clean and readable code. Make sure your implementation is well-organized, uses appropriate naming conventions, and follows best practices. This will help others understand your code easily.

Successful Test Execution: Ensure that all the unit tests pass successfully. The tests are designed to verify the correctness of your implementation. Feel free to modify and add additional tests if you believe it will enhance the evaluation.

Bonus: Clear Explanation: As an additional challenge, we encourage you to explain your thought process and the logic behind your implementation. You can achieve this by adding clear comments throughout your code, highlighting important decisions or describing complex sections. This will provide valuable insights into your problem-solving abilities.

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your submission!
